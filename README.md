## Project Description
  MyGallery is a web app that allows users to view several photos posted by the author (in this case myself). The users also get click on an image and view an enlarged version of the photo, together with other details of the photo.<br>

  A user can also search for some photos under a certain category in the navigation bar. They can also view images based on where those images were taken (location) and also copy a link on the photo to share with others.
